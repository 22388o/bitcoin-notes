# Build

Bitcoin Core is supposed to run on [various operating
systems](https://github.com/fanquake/core-review/blob/master/operating-systems.md). Apparently this
does not magically just work, even if it looks like it.

General build questions that dummies have

- Wait, there r different compilers????

- How do I get from a list of .cpp files to an executable (can just link to a 61c lesson)


Bitcoin Core-related questions that dummies have

- What happens when you run ./autogen.sh

- What happens when you run ./configure

- What happens when you run make

- How do I read the logs are printed

- How subtrees (minisketch, univalue, libsecp256) are built

- How depends (qt, boost) are built
