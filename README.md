# bitcoin-notes

Hi! You've stumbled upon my personal notes about bitcoin and bitcoin core.
None of this information is supposed to be official, but sometimes I share it casually with friends.
Feel free to browse, but please don't expect things to be up-to-date or extremely precise.
Of course, if something doesn't look right, please feel free to correct me :) always happy to learn!
