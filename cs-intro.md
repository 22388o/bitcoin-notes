# Introduction to Bitcoin for CS Students


I think introductory material for Bitcoin usually has to do a lot of the heavy-lifting in abstracting away technical concepts,
and thus has to water down the point.
In my opinion, the result is often preachy or sounds over-promising.
This is how I would explain Bitcoin to you if you already have some sort of academic computer science background.
